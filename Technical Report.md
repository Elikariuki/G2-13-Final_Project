# Introduction

### Migration Strategy for SQL Database Cluster on Azure

#### High-Level Architecture Diagram
#### Migration Phases
1. Phase 1: Assessment
Use Azure Migrate Database Assessment tool to:
- Analyze the compatibility of the current SQL database schema and data with Azure SQL 2. Managed Instance or Azure SQL Database.
- Identify dependencies on legacy systems and connected applications.
- Estimate the data size and identify performance bottlenecks.

Phase 2: Planning
1. Select Target:
- Use Azure SQL Managed Instance for near-complete SQL Server feature parity.
- Choose Azure SQL Database for a more scalable, PaaS-first solution.
2. Define Migration Methodology:
- For minimal downtime, use Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) in online migration mode.
- Plan a fallback strategy in case of migration issues.
3. Compliance Planning:
- Use Azure Policy to enforce GDPR/HIPAA compliance.
- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for data-at-rest.
- Implement Always Encrypted for sensitive columns.
4. Network and Access Configuration:
- Plan VNet Integration and Firewall Rules for secure connectivity.
- Enable Azure Active Directory Authentication for secure user access.

Phase 3: Execution
1. Backup and Pre-Migration Testing:
- Take a full backup of the SQL database and test it for corruption or inconsistencies.
- Use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for schema validation.
2. Migration Execution:
- Configure Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the database.
- Monitor progress and validate intermediate stages.
3. Performance Testing:
- Conduct performance benchmarking to compare pre- and post-migration performance.
- Use Query Performance Insights in Azure SQL.

Phase 4: Validation
- Validate data integrity and application connectivity.
- Run end-to-end testing with connected systems.
- Ensure all compliance measures are functional.

Phase 5: Optimization and Handover
- Configure Azure Auto-Scaling and Index Tuning Advisor.
- Train operations teams on monitoring and managing Azure SQL databases.
- Document all changes and hand over control to the operations team.

#### Recommendations for Tools and Services
- Azure Migrate: For initial assessment and readiness checks.
- Azure Database Migration Service (DMS): For schema and data migration.
- Azure Monitor: For tracking performance metrics post-migration.
- Azure Key Vault: For securing encryption keys.
- Azure Security Center: For real-time threat detection and security assessments.
#### Cost Estimation
- Use Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate:
1. Compute costs for Azure SQL Managed Instance or Azure SQL Database.
2. Data storage costs based on data size and redundancy requirements.
3. Network and egress costs for data migration and ongoing operations.
4. Backup storage and disaster recovery options.
