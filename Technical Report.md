# Introduction

### Migration Strategy for SQL Database Cluster on Azure

#### High-Level Architecture Diagram
#### Migration Phases
1. Phase 1: Assessment
Use Azure Migrate Database Assessment tool to:
- Analyze the compatibility of the current SQL database schema and data with Azure SQL 2. Managed Instance or Azure SQL Database.
- Identify dependencies on legacy systems and connected applications.
- Estimate the data size and identify performance bottlenecks.

Phase 2: Planning
1. Select Target:
- Use Azure SQL Managed Instance for near-complete SQL Server feature parity.
- Choose Azure SQL Database for a more scalable, PaaS-first solution.
2. Define Migration Methodology:
- For minimal downtime, use Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) in online migration mode.
- Plan a fallback strategy in case of migration issues.
3. Compliance Planning:
- Use Azure Policy to enforce GDPR/HIPAA compliance.
- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for data-at-rest.
- Implement Always Encrypted for sensitive columns.
4. Network and Access Configuration:
- Plan VNet Integration and Firewall Rules for secure connectivity.
- Enable Azure Active Directory Authentication for secure user access.

Phase 3: Execution
1. Backup and Pre-Migration Testing:
- Take a full backup of the SQL database and test it for corruption or inconsistencies.
- Use SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for schema validation.
2. Migration Execution:
- Configure Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the database.
- Monitor progress and validate intermediate stages.
3. Performance Testing:
- Conduct performance benchmarking to compare pre- and post-migration performance.
- Use Query Performance Insights in Azure SQL.
